# Agent Instructions

## Agent skills

### Matt Pocock skill invocation

When the `mattpocock-skills` plugin is available, automatically use a model-invoked skill whose description matches the current task; these skills do not require the user to type a slash command. Use `/ask-matt` when skill routing is unclear. User-invoked workflows remain user-led. Do not force-fit a skill or let it override the user's request, this repository's governance/security rules, or deterministic evidence.

Prefer deterministic Git, text search, AST, hashes, tests, lint, typecheck, and build checks whenever they are sufficient. Use Jev only when available and useful for bounded context relevance, triage, classification, reranking, claim verification, comparison, or explicit-gate decisions. Jev output is advisory; never send it secrets or credentials.
